Indivisible Midlothian joined up with Indivisible Richmond and other local groups at the March for Truth this Saturday, June 3rd. Around 300 people rallied on Capital Square asking for Trump to release his tax returns and for an independent, transparent investigation into the Trump administration's ties to Russia. We were joined by keynote speaker Rep. Donald McEachin.
