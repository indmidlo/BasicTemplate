*Indivisible Midlothian (IM)*
Meeting Minutes

26 People In Attendance

*Bob Mesnard-Intro and Background
Starts meeting at 6:35pm, North Chesterfield Library Meeting Room.
Wants to reset group.  Indivisible Richmond is our umbrella group for the VA area. 
Diversity is a big priority
Local level to partner with other like-minded groups to expand our efforts
Indivisiblemidlothian.org-Calendar is important
Goal is to collaborate with Indivisible Richmond as well as with other groups. Working on by-laws. Once they are drafted they will be sent out to all members for feedback.
Important-IM is action oriented, for example getting people out there to vote. 
IM is policy based, we go after the policy not the person. We are here to support good policy and go after bad policy.
Concept of IM was to start with tactics of Tea Party. We are not just on the national level, we float down to the state and local level.

*Claire Fisher-Membership
Info is shared through website-go to join, upcoming events, success stories. Take pics and send to share on website and with other members.
Also info sent out for face to face meetings
Facebook is not our prime contact for members
Local Partnerships-We want that-go out and be a part of all other groups
To start we need to all get involved in an action group-Get training

*Terri Doughertry-Commitment
Commitment vs Involved, We need to be committed
Get up, show up, and talk to people-Follow your passion
We need to focus, find our drive, and divide and conquer-What is your driving force and passion-that’s where you start
	
*LeeAnn Newman-Activism 101
Look over the Indivisible Guide. Taking the good, effective parts of the Tea Party and using a local approach to effect change with members of congress. Record interactions with MOC, getting local media involved
Recommended tactics:
-Office Visits- Focus on one issue and go with a group. Report to media if they refuse to meet with you. 
-Town Hall Meetings-Focus is to get members of congress to listen and the supporters to hear you. 
-Community Meetings with Reps-
-Call the Halls-Good timing to call is when a vote is coming up
-Emails & Faxes-Resistbot
-Postcards & Letters to MOCs-Postcards don’t get screened like letters-Call now for postcard action for budget
-Demonstrations-Stage an event like a Die In if you can’t get in
-Supporting Allies-ICE out of Richmond, ACLU, LWCC, League of Conservation Voters, etc.
-Public Education-Put out the facts! Focus on our supporters and moderate middles, call out alternate facts
-Social Media-Twitter, Facebook, Viral Videos
-Letters to the Editor-Will only let you write so many of them at a given time. Great for local papers
-Websites and Blog Post-Can go to Dave Brat’s website and respond to his comments. Go to the congressman one so he doesn’t block you. Also good idea to congratulate our MOC when they do something good.

Q & A
-District 68-Ron is sending around info
