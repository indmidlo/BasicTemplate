A border and barbeque aren't the only things Virginia and North Carolina have in common. The two states also share some of the most gerrymandered districts in the country, cozy relationships between regulators and industry, and politicians that care more about serving their donors than their constituents. A new film called Democracy for Sale features NC native and comedian Zach Galifianakis and focuses on how big money political interests have led to a lack of environmental protection in North Carolina along with tax cuts for the upper class and corporations, education cuts, gerrymandering, and laws designed to decrease voter turnout.

Join us for a free screening and discussion of Democracy for Sale to learn more about the state of democracy in North Carolina, its parallels to Virginia, and all the ways we can fight back.
