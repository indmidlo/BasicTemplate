There will be hundreds of National Night Out events all across the greater Richmond Metro Area and we need your help to register as many voters for the upcoming November election as possible and help restore the rights of the disenfranchised. This will be a chance to take part in positive family friendly events while also making a huge difference in the community and in the Commonwealth.
