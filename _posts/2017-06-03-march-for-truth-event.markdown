As you are aware there is more than sufficient cause for alarm about the role Russian state-led hacking and information warfare played in the 2016 election, and there are crucial unanswered questions about the relationship between the Russian state and Donald Trump, his associates and his campaign. The legitimacy of the United States government may hinge on the answers to these questions. If the President was elected even in part due to collusion with a foreign effort to interfere in our democratic process, then the will of the people has been subverted. 

Our goals for this march are simple:
-Congressional investigations should be properly resourced and pursued free of partisan interests, or an independent investigation must be established;
-As much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible;
-Donald Trump should release his tax returns to clarify his business interests and obligations to any foreign entity;
-If crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, it must be prosecuted.
-Therefore, we call for a March for Truth to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that American citizens want answers.

The legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President. So, we will rise together to call for a fair and impartial investigation, for the pursuit of truth, and for the restoration of faith in our electoral system and the Office of the President.

We are working out the details on where and what time but wanted to give you the most advanced notice as possible.
