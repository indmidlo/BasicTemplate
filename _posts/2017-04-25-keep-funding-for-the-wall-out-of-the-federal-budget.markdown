call-script-text: 'Potential Script: Hi, my name is _____ and I''m a constituent from
  __City___Zip___. I''m calling to express my strong opposition to any federal budget
  that funds the construction of a southern border wall. At a conservative estimate
  of over 21 billion to build, it is the most expensive and least effective way to
  secure the border. It would also be deadly. Studies of border deaths have found
  that rates of border deaths increase with each new mile of wall constructed along
  the border since the 1990s. Illegal immigration is down, this is fraud, waste, and
  abuse.'
