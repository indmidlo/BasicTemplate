On January 28, 2017 Congressman Dave Brat said "women are in my grill no matter where I go", but these days it's Constituents, health providers, and insurance companies feeling the heat as uncertainty looms in healthcare.

American health care needs bipartisan reform, starting with commonsense changes to the Affordable Care Act. Congress has the power to make these changes and Concerned Citizens challenge Congressman Brat to help lead sensible reforms to improve the health of Americans and stabilize the insurance market by joining the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.

To prepare our Representative for this important role, We the People invite Congressman Brat to a public, citizen-led Town Hall on August 22nd at 6:30pm in which constituents share their personal health stories and experiences with insurance and the ACA. Hosts include: Culpeper Persisters, Indivisible Midlothian, Indivisible Richmond & Richmond City and Together We Will RVA. These groups represent 1000s of people in VA's 7th Congressional District who seek representation.

In an August 7th Washington Post article, Congressman Brat declined the invitation, but the offer still stands and we hope he will reconsider.

We ask Congressman Brat to listen to constituent healthcare and other concerns and questions. We encourage him to participate in ongoing dialogue in which concerned citizens, along with expert health professionals from across the field, help inform health care reform and legislation. And, we challenge him to take this knowledge and lead on Capitol Hill on our behalf - just as he was elected to do. Mutual respect and responsibility is key to legislative success and to exclude our voices will result in irresponsible and deadly legislation. Fellow legislators have already begun bipartisan talks in the Problem Solvers Caucus.

Improving patient outcomes and people's health should be the driving force behind healthcare decisions in America. Brat continues to divert and pivot from a serious health care conversation and align with partisan politics, corporate interests, Heritage Foundation and CATO-prepared messages, and ALEC-manufactured legislation. He has repeatedly said that he is anxious to "move on" from healthcare - even if it means rushing poorly considered legislation or letting our current care system fail - to "get on to tax reform". We say "NO" to this way of doing business. Letting the health care system die, or encouraging its failure by ending payments to insurance providers, harms people's lives and even lead to early death. We will also engage in other meaningful issues, such as Trump's budget plan, tax reform and Russian involvement in our democracy.
