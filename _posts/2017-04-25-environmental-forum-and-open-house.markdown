Please save the date for an environmental forum and open house.

Hosted by VA 7th District Concerned Citizens & LWCC - Liberal Women of 
Chesterfield County.

Come hear a panel of experts on Virginia environmental policies. Get the 
facts about current issues, from coal ash to the Chesapeake Bay cleanup and 
everything in between. Ask your questions about how our politicians' 
policies affect us all. Congressman Donald McEachin to speak.

There will be an open house with organizations handing out additional 
information on how you can become a better-educated citizen on 
environmental issues.

Come meet candidates and hear their ideas on how Virginia can be a leader 
for the environment in a Meet and Greet.

More information to come.
