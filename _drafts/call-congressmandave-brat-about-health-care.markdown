  “Hello my name is [name] in [zipcode]. I was pleased Brats opposition to the AHCA and would like to urge him to oppose any new healthcare law that would take away insurance and/or raise premiums for Americans.”

  “Hello my name is [name] in [zipcode]. I heard that amendments to the ACHA are in the works. Please let Congressman Brat know that he should work on fixing the ACA, not repealing it.”
